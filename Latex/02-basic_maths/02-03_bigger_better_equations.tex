% 1. Let's show em what LaTeX is all about: using an environment
The roots of a quadratic equation are given by 
\begin{equation}
    x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt {b^2 - 4ac}}
             {2a}
% Ooof where did you learn how to indent for readability like that??
\end{equation}

% 2. This one is for all those with stat problems
Time to find the probability of Type II error in any hypothesis testâ€“incorrectly concluding no statistical significance: beta.
\begin{equation*}
    \beta_i = 
    \frac{\text{Cov}(R_i, R_m)}
         {\operatorname{Var}(R_m)}
\end{equation*}

% 3. Aligning your values
Your manager at Rio Tinto wants you to prove a notorious high school proof:
The square root of 2 is irrational, namely $$\sqrt{2} \not\in \mathbb{Q}$$
\textbf{Proof:}\\
First, we need to use $\sqrt{2} > 1$.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Assume that $\sqrt{2}$ is rational $\implies \exists m, n \in \mathbb{Z},
          n \neq 0$ s.t. $m/n = \sqrt{2}$
    \item Then $\sqrt{2}$ can also be written as an irreducible fraction $m/n$ with
            positive integers, because $\sqrt{2} > 0$. This implies $\sqrt{2}n = m$
    \item Then
    % ok so this a huge learning point here
    \begin{align*}
        \sqrt{2} &= \frac{\sqrt{2} \cdot (\sqrt{2}-1)}
                         {n(\sqrt{2}-1)}\\~\\
                 &= \frac{2n - \sqrt{2}n}
                         {\sqrt{2}n-n}\\~\\
                 &= \frac{2n - m}{m - n}
    \end{align*}
    \item Since $\sqrt{2} > 1$, it follows that $m > n$, which in turn implies that         $m > 2n - m$.
    \item So the fraction $m/n$ for $\sqrt{2}$, which according to (2) is already in lowest terms, is represented by (3) in strictly lower terms. This is a contradiction, so the assumption that $\sqrt{2}$ is rational must be false.
\end{enumerate}

Mind f*cked? No? I'm impressed.
