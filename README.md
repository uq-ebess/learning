Resources from EBESS

## Subject Guide 2018

The 2018 executives have put a subject guide together to hopefully guide you through the courses in Electrical, Biomedical, Computer, Software, and Mechatronic Engineering.

## Learn To LaTeX
Each year EBESS hosts a LaTeX information event to invite students into the typesetting world. The 2018 event was revamped to focus on a more practical experience, and for those that missed it, the presentation is available here. All the resources and example files can be found below, where the latter can be used with a local editor 'as is' or uploaded to an online editor as .tex files.

### Presentation Resources 

Example Files: LaTeX_Examples 
Demo Images: LaTeX_Images 
ITEE Student Challenge: Thesis Submission Information

We also recommend one of the following downloads for using LaTeX on your own computer: 
TeXworks, TeXstudio, and TeXlipse (plugin for Eclipse IDE).

Alternatively, you can use a cloud-based LaTeX editor such as ShareLaTeX.
For all other LaTeX information, ShareLaTeX has an easily searchable and comprehensive set of documentation.

## Project Kits
Each year EBESS works to create a DIY project kit for you students to learn about and put together!
